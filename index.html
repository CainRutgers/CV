      <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>As a <strong>PhD candidate</strong> at the OLVG hospital, I am at the forefront of medical innovation, working with medical businesses to find <strong>cutting-edge solutions</strong> to the problems of today. I collaborate with multiple specialists from top medical institutions such as the <strong>OLVG hospital, UMC-AMC, UMC-VUmc and Deventer Hospital</strong>. My area of expertise is shoulder pathologies and I have a passion for researching <strong>artificial intelligence-based (imaging) solutions and surgical procedures</strong> for shoulder disorders. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful impact on patients and inspire future generations of medical students to become enthusiastic about research.</p>

        <p>In addition to my research, I was also a student <strong>tutor</strong> at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I supported first-year medicine students during the challenging time of Covid-19 lockdowns. Additionally, I served as an <strong>editor</strong> for SlimAcademy, where I wrote study material and summarized existing literature to support medicine students in their education. Also, I was an <strong>ambassador</strong> for SlimAcademy, where I helped organize and execute communications and worked closely with student associations.</p>
